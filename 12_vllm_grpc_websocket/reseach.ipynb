      ", a world without monsters was a world of peace and blessings. The sun shone brightly, the trees keeled over gracefully, and the creatures roamed freely. But one day, a group of monsters breathed their malevolent breath. They became increasingly bold, and soon, they were wreaking havoc all around. The innocent townspeople tried everything they could to defeat the monsters, but none worked. With no other choice, they decided to call on their greatest weapon — themselves. With their strength and might, they united, formed an army of monsters, and drove the monsters from the town. This world is now defined by a world of war and chaos. Neither humans nor monsters can trust one another. The peaceful world has given way to a world of terror, insanity, and chaos. Humans are strangers to one another, fending off monsters in fear. Elves and dwarves have lost their ways and now live in isolation, while goblins and trolls roam their land, both pitted against each other. The once magnificent creatures of nature are now mere prey to the powerful beasts\n"
